# Introduction

At first I was sceptical because I thought the course was more or less only math like I've heard about Computational Biology I but then a friend of mine who did it in the 4th semester recommended it to me.

I would like to learn about HPC computing because I think it will be very relevant in the future not only in biology but in a large scale of topics.

My expectations for the course are to learn how to use bigger networks to fulfill tasks that are out or range for normal desktop or laptop workstations.
Another goal for me would be to make coding a continuous hobby. I already enjoyed coding Python for the coding module in the third semester but after the module was completed
I didn't really know where to continue because I had no real idea about what projects to start.

## Github

I created a GitHub Account for the Python module in the 3rd Semester but never actually used it because there was no need.
Now working on different branches for the protocol and using my own repository to be able to work on scripts wherever I like is really cool,
even though at first the whole procedure of importing repositories into VS Code and switching between them melt my brain for a while.

## Markdown

Markdown seems like a great tool to create well designed and interactive files to share or to explain things.

## Linux

## SLURM

## First Project: AliScale 

For our first project, we decided to test different sequence alignment tools for their speed, also comparing the differnces betweend single and multi-
threaded runs.
We used:

..* Needle
..* BLAST
..* VSearch 

for comparison.
